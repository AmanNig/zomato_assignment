This project is an end-to-end Generative AI solution designed to enhance the restaurant discovery experience. It involves building a web scraper to collect real-time restaurant data (menus, prices, features, etc.) from multiple websites, and constructing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot capable of answering natural language queries like “Which restaurants offer gluten-free appetizers?” or “Compare spice levels in dishes from two restaurants.” Leveraging Hugging Face models, the chatbot retrieves relevant information from a structured knowledge base and generates contextual, helpful responses. The solution includes a user-friendly interface, is built entirely in Python, and demonstrates practical application of AI in the food-tech domain.
